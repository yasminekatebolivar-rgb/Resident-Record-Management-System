Barangay Resident Information Management System

1. Overview

The Barangay Resident Information Management System is a digital platform designed to help barangay staff efficiently record, organize, and manage resident and household information within the community. It replaces manual record-keeping methods such as paper forms and spreadsheets by providing a centralized and structured database.

This system is intended for single-user or admin-only use, typically by authorized barangay personnel. It allows the admin to add, update, search, and generate reports about residents, ensuring accurate data management for barangay operations, planning, and documentation.
